If anyone can think of stuff that really should be done for Coin 2.3.0
before release, please put it here.

* Implement following GL glue methods (might be needed if we change to render
  with vertex array techniques):

  cc_glglue_glPushClientAttrib()
  cc_glglue_glPopClientAttrib()

* Move SoTextureCombine to Coin-2

* Make sure the following new classes are properly documented.
    SoTextureUnit
    SoTextureCombine
    SoBumpMap
    SoSceneTexture2
