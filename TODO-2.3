If anyone can think of stuff that really should be done for Coin 2.3.0
before release, please put it here.

* COIN_DLL_API
  check new classes
  apply to C/base/rbptree.h, bundles/SoNormalBundle.h, caches/SoGLCacheList.h,
  caches/SoGLRenderCache.h, elements/SoClipPlaneElement.h

* Implement following GL glue methods (might be needed if we change to render
  with vertex array techniques):

  cc_glglue_glPushClientAttrib()
  cc_glglue_glPopClientAttrib()

* Move SoTextureCombine to Coin-2

* Fix all copyright headers that has been mutilated again, and fix
  copyright headers for Coin development...

* Make sure the following new classes are properly documented.
    SoTextureUnit
    SoTextureCombine
    SoBumpMap
    SoSceneTexture2
