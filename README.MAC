This file contains information about building Coin on Mac OS X.


Mac OS 10.0.x compatibility
==========================

First of all, please note that we do not support Mac OS X versions < 10.1 
Things will probably work just fine on 10.0.x as well if you are building 
Coin from the source yourself, but we do not make any guarantees. Our 
precompiled binary packages of Coin/Mac will not work on 10.0.x. In any
case, MacOS 10.1 was such a great step in performance and stability that
I strongly encourage you to upgrade from 10.0.x anyway (which should be
considered more like a "public beta", really). 

If you build Coin on a MacOS 10.1 system and want to use the library on
10.0.x, you will have to use the -flat_namespace linker switch. (Modify
the LDFLAGS environment variable to do that.) Do not do this unless you
are sure you what you are doing and have read (and fully understood)
Apple's Release Note concerning two-level namespace executables[0].


Mac OS 10.2
===========

If you are upgrading to Mac OS 10.2, you must recompile your Coin
library. This is due to the fact that the developer tools for Mac OS
10.2 are based on gcc.3.1, as opposed to gcc-2.95 in 10.1. These two
compilers are not ABI compatible - meaning that you have to rebuild 
_all_ your C++ libraries.

If you decide to build Coin from the source code, please cvs update
or download the latest snapshot (after 20020915). Note that there are 
several bugs in the developer tools that came with the original Mac 
OS 10.2 CDs, so you should install the update provided by Apple 
("August2002DevToolsUpdate") first.

A precompiled binary for the Coin framework on Mac OS 10.2 can be found
on our ftp server[1].


The Inventor framework
======================

By default, Coin will be set up as MacOS X framework. Frameworks are a
central concept to Mac OS X, packing a dynamic shared library with the
necessary resources for this library, like header files, images, and
documentation. You can link against a framework by using the "-framework" 
compiler option. Please refer to the Apple developer documentation [2] for 
more information about frameworks.

Since Coin is an OpenInventor implementation, the framework is named
"Inventor", not Coin. Following Apple's recommendation for 3rd-party
frameworks, the Inventor.framework is installed in /Library/Frameworks.

What this means, basically, is that instead of
"cc -I/path/to/Coin/include -L/path/to/Coin/lib -lCoin -lGL -lGLU -o foo 
foo.cpp",
your commandline would be something like
"cc -framework Inventor -framework OpenGL -o foo foo.cpp"

You can of course still use the coin-config script, which takes care of
all this (see man coin-config(1) for more information).

If you want to disable the creation of the framework and install Coin as
standalone shared library, you can use the configure option

--without-framework

which will install libCoin.dylib into $prefix/lib and the headers into
$prefix/include. 

Note that the configure option "-with-framework" is intended for
debugging purposes (to install as a framework on non-Macintosh systems)
only. You do not need it when you build Coin/Mac as a framework (the
default).


Project Builder IDE support
===========================

You can use the Inventor.framework like any of Apple's frameworks in
Project Builder by just drag+and+dropping it into your target settings.
Please note that you will (of course) also need the OpenGL framework,
and (if you are using GLUT) the GLUT framework. 

(Mac OS 10.2 users: See also the problem note on  __Znwm below.)


SoMac?
=======

We are planning to implement a "SoMac" library with bindings between
Cocoa and the Coin library in the long run, but this is just in the
planning phase.

At the moment, your best option is probably to control your own
OpenGL-canvas, like done in the glutiv.cpp example found on the
<URL:http://www.coin3d.org> website. A simple example on how to use 
Coin from the Cocoa environment is provided here[3].

You can also try and use SoQt (which depends on Qt/Mac, released
recently by Trolltech), but please note that this is still under
development, so you might stumble into some bugs every once in a 
while.


Common problems (and solutions)
===============================

o Directory names with spaces
  ----------------------------

There seem to be some problems with Automake when the path to the Coin
configure directory contains spaces. A typical warning you would get in
this case is "configure: WARNING: `missing' script is too old or
missing." -- Things seem to work in spite of this, but I wouldn't rely
on it.

Until this has been fixed, I suggest the obvious workaround of not 
having any spaces in the path leading to Coin.


o "Undefined symbol: __Znwm"
  --------------------------

If you try to build a project using Coin in Project Builder, you might
get an error message about __Znwm being undefined. Mac OS 10.2 comes 
with two version of libstc++, so you must tell it which ones to use - 
namely the same one used for building Coin. Adding the following to the
linker commandline solves the problem: 

    "-L/usr/lib/gcc/darwin/default/private/"

For those who are unfamiliar with Project Builder's settings, a short
instruction follows:

  - Open the project in ProjectBuilder.
  - Click on the "Targets" tab.
  - Choose target "Coin-in-a-Cocoa-Nutshell". This brings up the
    settings window in the project builder main window. 
  - Click on "Settings" (in the menu in the main window), "simple view",
    "Linker settings".
  - There, in "Other Mach-O Linker Flags", enter 
    "-L/usr/lib/gcc/darwin/default/private/" .
  - Press Shift-Command-k, or choose "Build -> clean" from the project 
    builder menubar.
  - Rebuild.

That should be it.

If you have any problems when trying to configure and build Coin on
MacOS X, please let us know. 


o There is no uninstaller
  -----------------------

Mac OS X does not come with a native uninstaller utility (strange
enough), but the OS X Gnu project has created a Cocoa appplication
that you can get here[4]. We haven't tried it, though, so your milage
may vary...

The short and simple way is to just delete the installed files by
typing the following into a Terminal window:

  sudo rm -r /Library/Framework/Inventor.framework
  [now you will be asked for your Administrator password]
  sudo rm -r /Library/Receipts/Coin-1.0.3.pkg
  sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/Coin
  sudo rm /usr/local/bin/coin-config
  sudo rm /usr/local/man/man1/coin-config.1
