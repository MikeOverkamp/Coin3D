This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Coin.pkg
to start installation. If you do not want to use an installer, you can
find a package containing only the framework itself (called
Coin-@VERSION@-Jaguar-no_inst.dmg) at ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

If you intend to develop without using ProjectBuilder/Xcode, you
should also install the CoinTools package, which contains the
coin-config commandline utility, its associated man page, and its
default configuration. The coin tools are a convenience if you want to
build Coin applications from the Terminal, and are also needed when
compiling SoQt.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.1 and will not
work with gcc 3.3. It is primarily meant for use on Mac OS 10.2
"Jaguar" and will only work on Mac OS 10.3 "Panther" if you manually
select the 3.1 compiler.  Please make sure to also read the relevant
FAQ entry at http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq.html#gcc_abi

Check out http://www.coin3d.org/mac for information on how to get
started using Coin.

Enjoy!
