This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click
on Coin.pkg to start installation. If you do not want to
use an installer, you can find a package containing
only the framework itself (called Coin-@VERSION@-Jaguar-no_inst.dmg) at
ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.1
and will not work with gcc 3.3. It is primarily meant for
use on Mac OS 10.2 "Jaguar" and will only work on Mac OS
10.3 "Panther" if you manually select the 3.1 compiler.
