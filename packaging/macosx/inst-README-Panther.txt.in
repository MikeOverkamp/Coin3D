This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Coin.pkg
to start installation. If you do not want to use an installer, you can
find a package containing only the framework itself (called
Coin-@VERSION@-no_inst.dmg) at ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

If you intend to develop without using Xcode, you should also install
the CoinTools package, which contains the coin-config commandline
utility, its associated man page, and its default configuration. The
coin tools are a convenience if you want to build Coin applications
from the Terminal, and are also needed when compiling SoQt.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.3, meaning
that no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. The framework is, however, built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
later versions of Mac OS X.
