This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click
on Coin.pkg to start installation. If you do not want to
use an installer, you can find a package containing
only the framework itself (called Coin-@VERSION@-Panther-no_inst.dmg) at
ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.3
and will only work on Mac OS 10.3 "Panther". If you are using
Mac OS 10.2 "Jaguar" (or want your applications to be compatible
with Jaguar), use the package named Coin-@VERSION@-Jaguar.dmg
instead. Please make sure to also read the relevant FAQ entry
at http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq.html#gcc_abi
