This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Coin.pkg
to start installation. If you do not want to use an installer, you can
find a package containing only the framework itself (called
Coin-@VERSION@-no_inst.dmg) at ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

If you intend to develop without using ProjectBuilder/Xcode, you
should also install the CoinTools package, which contains the
coin-config commandline utility, its associated man page, and its
default configuration. The coin tools are a convenience if you want to
build Coin applications from the Terminal, and are also needed when
compiling SoQt.

Check out http://www.coin3d.org/mac for information on how to get
started using Coin.

Enjoy!
