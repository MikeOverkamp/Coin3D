This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. What you have downloaded
is only the framework itself, provided as a convienience for those who
do not want to use binary installers. To install, simply drag the
Inventor.framework to /Library/Frameworks.

You can find a complete package including an installer and the Coin
commandline tools at our ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.3, meaning
that no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. The framework is, however, built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
later versions of Mac OS X.
