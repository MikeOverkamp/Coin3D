This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. What you have downloaded
is only the framework itself, provided as a convienience for those who
do not want to use binary installers. To install, simply drag the
Inventor.framework to /Library/Frameworks.

You can find a complete package including an installer and the Coin
commandline tools at our ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.3 and will
only work on Mac OS 10.3 "Panther". If you are using Mac OS 10.2
"Jaguar" (or want your applications to be compatible with Jaguar), use
the package named Coin-@VERSION@-Jaguar-no_inst.dmg instead. Please
