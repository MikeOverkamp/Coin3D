This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. What you have downloaded
is only the framework itself, provided as a convienience for those who
do not want to use binary installers. To install, simply drag the
Inventor.framework to /Library/Frameworks.

You can find a complete package including an installer and the Coin
commandline tools at our ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.1 and will not
work with gcc 3.3. It is primarily meant for use on Mac OS 10.2
"Jaguar" and will only work on Mac OS 10.3 "Panther" if you manually
select the 3.1 compiler.  Please make sure to also read the relevant
FAQ entry at http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq/#gcc_abi
