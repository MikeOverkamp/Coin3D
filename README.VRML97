FIXME: this is just pederb's internal TODO-list at the moment. Should
be cleaned up to contain a proper list of status, missing features and
good-to-know stuff about Coin's VRML97 support. 20021108 mortene.

-- 


Investigate before release
==========================

- renderCaching++ fields in Transform should not be exported
  (do a setDefault(TRUE) on those fields in the first write pass)

- material handling when doing textures. It seems like RGB textures
  should overwrite the diffuse color entirely. This sounds weird though.


Not supported
=============

- MovieTexture
- Collision
- Script (needs some callback so that an application can handle it).
- NavigationInfo (should be handled by browser, bindable)
- EXTERNPROTO (needs code to fetch definition from an URL)

Needs more testing
==================

- Anchor
- Billboard
- Inline
- NavigationInfo
- PointLight, SpotLight and DirectionalLight (should affect the entire group)
- ROUTE export
- Should probably test PROTO export better as well
