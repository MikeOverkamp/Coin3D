Also, a number of bugs deemed to be obsolete due to age or obscurity
of environment they can be reproduced in, has been moved out of this
file. So also for bugs of little consequence, or for other reasons of
being of very low priority. They have been moved into catalogs under:

Now, for the list of (possibly) significant bugs in the core Coin
library:

005 Free memory read on connected SoSFEnum fields?

    This is an old problem which might have been fixed now, but we
    should check it with Valgrind: Purify used to report "Free memory
    read" when deleting SoSFEnum fields that were connected to other
    fields.

031 Setting up the alpha channel for the offscreen renderer doesn't
    consistently (between hosts) produce a transparent background when
    using setComponents(SoOffscreenRenderer::RGB_TRANSPARENCY).  It
    works at home on my Debian Linux w/ GeForce4MX440 with the 3123
    NVIDIA GLX sources, but not at work with whatever gfx system I
    have there.

    20020927 larsa.

    UPDATE 20020927 mortene: this could simply be caused by the GLX /
    X11 drivers lacking support for any alpha-enabled visuals
    (according to spec, it is not guaranteed that any such visual is
    available). Anyway, the right way to solve this problem is to 1)
    write our own weight-function for X11 visuals (like it's been done
    for MSWin visuals in SoWin's SoWinGLWidget.cpp), for better
    control of the selection process. Then 2) warn the user if we
    can't get hold of any visual capable of all requested features.

    UPDATE 20021022 larsa: this was the case - old XFree3 with old
    Mesa does not support alpha for offscreen rendering.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa: The offscreen renderer GL context creation
    is nevertheless bogus (with GLX at least), and should be fixed so
    the best possible context is created.

    UPDATE 20060203 mortene: a *lot* has been improved about offscreen
    rendering contexts since the last update on this bug, but the
    selection process among the available contexts has still not been
    fixed, nor exposed to the user in the form of any public API.

    We should of course never crash when importing any .iv or .wrl

    a robust manner by using SoReadError::post() and aborting the

044 Release builds on Cygwin/MSVC++ doesn't heed all configure
    options.

    Specifically, "--disable-symbols" should remove the "/Zi" option
    to cl.exe, and "--enable-optimization" should add "/O2" (or some
    such).

    20021118 mortene, problem reported by Michael Wimmer on
    coin-discuss.

    20021118 larsa - the --disable-symbols problem is fixed, and I'm
    against adding "--enable-optimization".  The users should rather
    specify the optimization options they want in CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS.

    20021121 larsa: since Autoconf automatically adds -O2, we should
    consider adding an option to remove that option, if it can be
    made to work without touching user-set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS and only
    the autoconf-set optimization-options.  Tricky stuff...

045 SoCenterballManip rotation off-center.

    When dragging the 'stripes' on a CenterballManip node, rotation
    happen around an off-center axis. (Off CenterballManip center)
    This happen for rotations around all the axis.

    NOTE: The bug is not visible if there is no connected geometry, or
    if the geometry is 'simple', like one cube or one cone.

    A simple scene-graph to reproduce:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator{
        CenterballManip {}

	}
    }

    UPDATE 20030408 mortene: there is also a second bug here; the
    scene bounding box is not calculated correctly, as can be seen by
    loading this into e.g. the ExaminerViewer. The near clip plane
    will clip part of the manip's geometry, something which should
    never happen.

=====================================================================

047 SoAntiSquish seems to trigger a bug in our matrix factoring code.

    From a coin-discuss posting by Philippe Debanné:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    I am planning to design my own Dragger class and have been looking
    at the Toolmaker Ch. 8 examples: TranslateRadialDragger and
    RotTransDragger.  I found an unexpected behaviour of
    RotTransDragger (top-left of scene): When dragging one of the
    SoRotateCylindricalDraggers, the dragger will switch from rotation
    to scaling up as the mouse position approaches and goes beyond the
    bounding cylinder of the (spherical) dragger.  In fact, the
    dragger should not do any scaling up/down!! This happens
    systematically when dragging the horizontal band left or right
    (Y-axis rotation).

    When I comment out the SoAntiSquish part of RotTransDragger, this
    unexpected behaviour dissapears (But obviously you want the
    AntiSquish's anti-squishing behaviour!).  Alternately, if I set
    its 'recalcAlways' field to FALSE, I get a different strange
    behaviour: manipulation of the RotTransDragger affects the
    rendering of the RotTransManip to the right of it: its
    antisquishing scaling factor and fluctuations of its wire-mesh
    sphere.  All this seems to be independant of the AntiSquish
    'sizing' field, e.g.  BIGGEST_DIMENSION or LONGEST_DIAGONAL.

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    pederb has investigated, and found that this seems likely to be a
    problem with our SbMatrix code that factors the translation,
    scaling and rotation out of a matrix.

048 Building SGI InventorXt on top of Coin reveals compile-time
    incompabilities.

    A Coin user reported two problems on coin-discuss:

        - InventorXt uses an Inventor-internal include file:
          Inventor/SoDebug.h. This contains a set of static debugging
          helper methods. They seem easy enough to implement, so
          perhaps we should do that.

        - Some explicit inclusion of SbTime.h is needed with Coin,
          that is not necessary with SGI Inventor. This is an
          incompatibility that we would like to get rid of, to make
          porting _other_ code from SGI Inventor to Coin a literal
          no-brainer.

051 ExaminerViewer's automatic initial "view all" doesn't work on
    a scene graph with SoImage.

    Reproduce with the following source code snippet. The
    "aass_logo.rgb" is an image of dimensions 80x68 (I haven't
    investigated if this matters or not).

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoImage.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>

    int
    main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      QWidget * mainwin = SoQt::init(argv[0]);

      SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
      root->ref();

      root->addChild(new SoCone);

      SoImage * img = new SoImage;
      root->addChild(img);
      img->filename = "aass_logo.rgb";

      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(mainwin);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(root);

      SoQt::show(mainwin);
      SoQt::mainLoop();

      delete viewer;
      root->unref();

      return 0;
    }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    Notice how the cone is a tiny dot in the lower left corner of the
    image at first. Then click view all (the eye icon) and see how the
    camera is then positioned where it should be. Correct behavior
    would be for the camera to be positioned there from the start.

    20030103 mortene.

    WONTFIX? 20030225 rolvs: In this example, setSceneGraph calls
    viewAll() before the window is 'show'-ed. The viewport region
    passed to (*SoCamera)->viewAll( graph, vpreg ) is therefore wrong,
    causing a malformed boundingbox for the image and thus a malformed
    view.

    UPDATE 20030225 mortene: is there any simple and clean way to
    detect and handle this with a) a warning message for the app
    programmer, b) using a decent "dummy" / default region?

=====================================================================

052 MSWin dependency walker gives surprising results.

    We have a report that Coin and SoQt configure with
    --with-msvcrt=multithread-dynamic-debug will still have a
    dependency on *both* msvcrtd.dll and msvcrt.dll.

    Should investigate closer whether this is to be expected or not,
    and if yes, how this can happen.

    20030122 mortene.

=====================================================================

054 SoComputeBoundingBox engine probably fails with viewport-dependent
    geometry.

    The SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox example fails with a small
    scene with an SoText2 in it:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Cube { }
    Translation { translation 10 0 0 }
    Text2 { string [ "hepp", "tjo-bing", "hupp" ] }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    ..and pederb tracked this down to a failure of the engine's
    evaluate() to be called again when the camera position changes.

    Note that this bug is probably rather hard to fix properly.

060 SoToVRML2Action failing with VRML97 nodes.

    Reported by kintel:

            coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2, -1 ]
          }
        }

      }
      ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<----

      This is a special case as it is already a VRML2 file. However, I
      guess the action will also fail given a mixed scene graph as
      input. This is a bigger issue since we often have situations
      with mixed scene graphs and want to convert them to VRML2."

    We've also had at least one external report from a user who found
    this to be a real problem. From the problem report:

      After some tests I've found that the problem seems to be that
      VRML shapes instead of being copied through by the ToVRML2
      action (they are obviously already VRML2), they are deleted
      (ignored?). It looks like that src/actions/SoToVRML2Action.cpp
      lacks one more callback to handle nodes already in VRML2 format.

    This is a medium priority item.

    &, const SbVec3f &): Assertion `0' failed.

    FIX: The correct thing to do is to track downwards to the "uppermost"
    place in the call-stack where whatever causes this error condition is
    still an _invalid_ condition. Then go one more step down and catch the
    problem there (by spitting out a warning and otherwise handle the

    See the VRML1 file below containing 5 line segments as separate
    linesets.  Using this file, the viewAll button in the examiner
    viewer only _almost_ zooms out the camera enough: parts of the
    model is outside the view.

    To reproduce:

    o Open model in an examiner viewer.
    o Resize the window so height ~= 2* width.
    o Rotate the model so you get minimal total height in the view.
    o Press viewall. If my problems doesn't show, rotate around the up
      axis and press viewall repeatedly until error occurs.

    I tried the model in the SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox
    example, and the bounding box gets calculated correctly. I guess
    that means there's a bug in either SoCamera::viewAll() or in
    SoGuiViewer::viewAll() -- most likely the latter.

      test: /home/sigma/mortene/code/coin-head/src/misc/SoBase.cpp:248: void set_current_writeref(const SoBase *, int): Assertion `rc >= 0 && "buggy writerefcounter"' failed.
      Aborted

    This points at some very nasty error, where some part of the scene
    graph is not tagged for writing on the first SoWriteAction pass,
    but is still attempted written on the second pass.

    It's really lame that we have this kind of bug at all, as having
    the two passes traverse the same structures shouldn't be rocket
    science.

    When writing as ASCII, the assert does *not* hit -- which means
    traversal is different somewhere for binary and ascii export.

    UPDATE 20050610 mortene: it seems someone (pederb?) rewrote the
    assert, and made the code "kinder", as there are now warnings
    instead:

        Coin warning in SoWriterefCounter::setWriteref(): writeref < 0 for <noname> <0x806d6a8>

073 Multiple complexity settings for same SoTexture2 does not work.

    Using the same SoTexture2 nodes with different
    SoComplexity::textureQuality settings is something which works for
    SGI Inventor, so it should be considered a Coin bug.

    Reproducible problem, example file:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
       Separator {
          Complexity { textureQuality 0.1 }

          DEF mytex Texture2 {
             image 2 2 3
             0xffffff 0x00ff00   # white   green
             0xff0000 0xffff00   #  red    yellow
          }

          Cube { }
       }

       Separator {
          Complexity { textureQuality 1.0 }
          USE mytex
          Translation { translation 5 0 0 }
          Cube { }
       }
    }

    pederb's comments on the bug:

        We handled this earlier, but when adding proper support for
        auto-caching, it was easier to store everything for a texture
        object inside the texture object, and then identify it with a
        single uint32. Then it's quite easy to figure out the current
        texture object after a display list has been executed (the
        render-cache must store the OpenGL state changes it does so
        that SoGLLazyElement is updated after the display list has
        been executed). I could add additional variables for storing
        the filter settings, but I just couldn't see any practical
        reason for doing this.


    20030916 mortene.

    UPDATE 20040714 mortene: an external Coin user (Nigel Murry) had
    an ingenious way to use a texture multiple times with varying
    complexity settings, which now fails -- so there are indeed
    practical uses for this. So we should really consider this a bug,
    and a fairly high priority item aswell, as this is a regression
    versus older Coin versions.

    From Murry's bug report on coin-discuss:

        I have been using textures to show how some parameter (like
        say temperature) varies over the surface of an
        object. Sometimes I would like to see distinct color bands and
        other times I would like to see a continuous variation of
        color. So I have a SoTexture2 defined using 8 or 16 color
        levels. Then I change bewteen a "banded" and a continuous
        display using a SoComplexity node with textureQuality set to
        0.00001 for a banded display.

        That normally works fine, but when the texture is used more
        than once there appears to be some confusion as to how the
        textureQuality is used. In the attached little iv file, if the
        switch at line 7 is off (whichChild=-1) then the second
        (legend) use is correct. If the switch at line 7 is on
        (whichChild=-3) then the second use shows a continuous
        texture.

=====================================================================

074 SoComplexity::textureQuality changes must be made before
    SoTexture2 traversal.

    In the "Inventor spirit" of appearance settings not having any
    effect until hitting a shape node, it should be possible to do
    this:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
      Texture2 {
         image 2 2 3
         0xffffff 0x00ff00   # white   green
         0xff0000 0xffff00   #  red    yellow
      }

      Complexity { textureQuality 0 }

      Cube { }
    }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..but the SoComplexity node will have no effect in this case. I
    feel it should.

    Note that SGI Inventor doesn't handle this either, but I still
    think it is a weakness in Coin which we should fix.

075 SoHandleBoxManip does not behave correctly when locking a
    translation axis.

    To reproduce, load this simple iv-file into an examinerviewer:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    HandleBoxManip { }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..then hold down SHIFT while LMB-clicking on one of the sides (for
    translation). The translation will correctly be locked to one
    axis, but when releasing the SHIFT button, the manip will jump to
    the current cursor location. This last behavior is incorrect.

    20030922 mortene.

=====================================================================

076 SoHandleBoxManip does not behave well upon "deep Z translation".

    To reproduce, load this simple iv-file into an examinerviewer:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    HandleBoxManip { }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..then move the box out to the left side of the view
    (i.e. translate in -X), before LMB-clicking the right side of the
    box to translate in the Z direction. The manip will correctly move
    in the Z direction when moving the mouse cursor to the right, but
    upon continuing moving the mouse cursor to the right it suddenly
    misbehaves by first jumping back close to the camera, and then
    starting to move in the *negative* Z direction.

    This is clearly bad handling of some kind of border case.

078 Perl "soft" dependency not properly handled.

    The doxy4win.pl script is attempted run under MSWindows during
    build, even when Perl is not installed on the system.

    Should at least use a configure check for a working Perl
    interpreter, and disable document generation if not present. (Or
    perhaps try to solve this by removing the Perl dependency.)

    This is a very minor problem.

    20031009 mortene, reported by kintel.

=====================================================================

082 Configure/build problem: we need to demand X11 when using GLX.

    As it is now, it's possible on certain platforms (at least
    experienced on Sun Solaris) that GLX linking is found to be ok by
    configure, even though X11 linking failed.

    This will then cause problems at compile or linkage later on, so
    we should detect this in the configure script and warn properly.

090 Scene graph copy behavior deviates from SGI Inventor.

    For the code example below, we get different behavior on
    connection copying between Coin and SGI Inventor. For Coin, the
    node with the slave field is not copied (the connection is just
    shortcut), while it is copied for SGI Inventor.

-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------

  SoRotor * slaverotor = new SoRotor;

  SoRotor * rotor = new SoRotor;

  rotor->rotation.connectFrom(&masterrotor->rotation);
  slaverotor->speed.connectFrom(&rotor->speed);

  printf("rotor==%p, masterrotor==%p, slaverotor==%p\n",
         rotor, masterrotor, slaverotor);


  SoRotor * copiedrotor = (SoRotor *)rotor->copy(TRUE);

  SoField * f;
  SbBool ok = copiedrotor->rotation.getConnectedField(f);
  assert(ok);
  SoRotor * copiedmaster = (SoRotor *)f->getContainer();

  SoFieldList slavelist;
  int nr = copiedrotor->speed.getForwardConnections(slavelist);
  assert(nr==0 || nr==1);
  SoRotor * copiedslave = nr ? (SoRotor *)slavelist[0]->getContainer() : NULL;

  printf("copiedrotor==%p, copiedmaster==%p, copiedslave==%p\n",
         copiedrotor, copiedmaster, copiedslave);

  return 0;
}
-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------

    A test run:

        copiedrotor==0x807e248, copiedmaster==0x807c740, copiedslave==(nil)

    SGI Inventor:

        copiedrotor==0x8059cb8, copiedmaster==0x8051690, copiedslave==0x8059df0

    (Notice the differences for 'copiedslave'.)

    This is a quite nasty bug, which can cause hard to debug errors
    when moving code from SGI Inventor to Coin.

         copiedrotor, copiedmaster, copiedslave);

  return 0;
}
-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------

    In addition to an error with the slave, which has been mentioned
    in bug #090, there is another error with our copy functionality:
    SGI Inventor copies the master engine we're connected to, while we
    only copy the actual connection back to the same engine.

    A test run:

    Coin:
        rotor==0x807dd70, masterrotor==0x807d510, slaverotor==0x807c990
        copiedrotor==0x807f198, copiedmaster==0x807d510, copiedslave==(nil)

    SGI Inventor:

        copiedrotor==0x80594d8, copiedmaster==0x805a2f0, copiedslave==0x8059628

    (Notice how masterrotor and copiedmaster is the same for Coin,
    while different for SGI Inventor.)

    pederb has a patch below that "fixes" the problem, but this is not
    a proper fix. Somebody needs to investigate to figure out what is
    really going on. A good start would perhaps be to test on a
    variety of different OpenGL drivers to figure out whether or not
    it is a weakness with NVidia's drivers.

099 View frustum culling is not done unless there are cached bounding
    boxes available.

    E.g. if an app programmer calls setAutoClipping(FALSE) on a
    standard viewer, SoGetBoundingBoxAction will not be invoked each
    frame, and there is no other mechanism in Coin which triggers the
    calculation and storage of bounding boxes.

    This is not a bug, but a performance enhancement suggestion. It
    can have a dramatic effect under certain circumstances.

    pederb suggests this can be solved by letting SoGLRenderAction
    invoke an SoGetBoundingBoxAction on the root node before
    rendering.

    20031211 mortene, reported by pederb.

    UPDATE 20040909 mortene: the above suggestion for a fix may not be
    such a good idea:

      : And: why don't we implement pederb's suggestion (applying a
      : GetBoundingBoxAction before rendering)?

      [pederb:]

      I feel it should be possible to toggle this feature on/off.
      Other applications might apply an SoGetBoundingBoxAction before
      they call SoSceneManager::render() (or render the scene using an
      SoGLRenderAction directly). If you have a scene with lots of
      animations, SoGetBoundingBoxAction can be pretty slow.

      If you have an application that does multipass rendering, and we
      apply an SoGetBoundingBoxAction every time
      SoGLRenderAction::apply() is called, that would be pretty bad.


    Note: when this bug has been fixed, remove the warning note on
    So@Gui@Viewer::setAutoClipping() which mentions this problem.

=====================================================================

102 Lack of control over OffscreenRenderer context setup

    There is currently no way to enable stencil-buffer and other GL
    features when creating the SoOffscreenRenderer context.  There
    should be a way to control offscreen renderer features in some
    way.  Requested by Josh Flowers.

    20040203 larsa.


    UPDATE 20040203 mortene: my suggestion is that the API should
    present the possibility of setting up a callback weighting
    function to run the available GL-capable contexts through, because
    this will give the API client full control if he/she so wishes.

    Something like this has already been implemented internally for
    SoWin, see SoWinGLWidget::weighPixelFormat(). I.e. default
    weighting algorithms like that function should be available inside
    libCoin, with the option of overriding them through the API.

    Designing the API so it manages to abstract away the peculiarities
    of each window-specific (GLX / WGL / AGL) context struct format
    might be challenging.

    UPDATE 20040922 mortene: there have been several more requests for
    this feature. Lacking control over the GL context capabilities can
    be a serious show-stopper for programmers wanting to use e.g. the
    stencil buffer, so I consider this a medium-to-high priority item.

    UPDATE 20050510 mortene: something like this has been implemented
    by TGS, with among others the SoGLGraphicConfigTemplate class.
    Consider using the same design and API.

=====================================================================

103 Need more 'ivinfo' information

    We should be able to see which version of simage and freetype
    and similar libraries has been detected by Coin.  The simage
    information should also list supported file types / plugin APIs
    in use.  The full path to the actual libraries would also be
    nice to see.  Too often people wonder why textures don't load -
    this would give that answer right away.

    Note: Duplicate bug entry (025) in SoQt/BUGS.txt because this
    must be implemented in cooperation between both libraries.

    20040218 larsa

=====================================================================

108 SoVRMLBackground (and SoVRMLImageTexture?) texturing doesn't work
    with SoOffscreenRenderer.

    Most likely because SoVRMLBackground uses an SoVRMLImageTexture,
    which loads textures in the background (if Coin is configured with
    platform-independent mt-support, which is the default). So on the
    first frame, which is what the SoOffscreenRenderer grabs, textures
    will not have completed loading yet.

    Should perhaps best be solved by using a new element
    "SoSynchronizedElement", or some such, which tells traversal
    operations whether or not they are allowed to run in parallel
    threads. SoOffscreenRenderer should then add such an element
    before invoking the SoGLRenderAction.

    20040427 mortene.

    UPDATE 20050505 mortene: Colin Dunlop reported another effect of
    this; fractured textures (i.e. SoTextureScalePolicy::policy set to
    FRACTURE) will typically render in low quality. The fix outlined
    above should also be the underpinning for taking care of this
    problem.

    When this problem has been properly taken care of, remove the
    following hack from src/misc/SoOffscreenRenderer (which doesn't
    seem to work):

      const int bigimagechangelimit = SoGLBigImage::setChangeLimit(INT_MAX);

    (And check whether or not there are any similar hacks to also take
    care of.)

    UPDATE 20050512 mortene: correction; fractured textures are not
    scaled or otherwise prepared in separate threads, but gradually in
    multiple render passes. The SoGLBigImage::setChangeLimit() is
    there to make sure that all necessary preparations are made on the
    first pass. This seems to work correctly upon some slight testing
    with the following iv-file:

    I'm therefore not quite sure what the problem is at Colin's end,
    so I've asked for more information. (My best guess is that it is
    downscaling of tremendously large textures to not-so-large
    offscreen pixmaps which may look bad, due to scaling algorithms
    tuned for speed, not quality, in SoGLBigImage.)

110 SoNodeKitListPart::getChildren()->truncate(0) causes mayhem.

    Reported by Jacob Støren / Fedem. Not surprising this, and there
    are probably other ways that unexpected use of the SoChildList
    returned from the virtual SoNode::getChildren() may cause
    problems. Should audit.

114 VRML-nodes are erroneously renamed upon import.

    VRML-nodes can legally be named in ways which are not ok for
    ordinary Inventor/Coin nodes. They are therefore sometimes renamed
    in error upon import of VRML97-files, from within SoBase::setName().

    I suggest this is fixed within SoBase::setName(), by making the
    code check whether or not the class is internal and has the
    "SoVRML" prefix, and if so; do the Right Thing wrt the VRML97
    spec.

    (BTW, do we have the same problem wrt VRML 1 nodes?)

    According to kintel, this is probably quite a bit of work to do
    properly, one will for instance have to read node names in UTF-8.

    20040521 mortene, bug reported by kintel.

=====================================================================

115 SoBaseKit::setPart() is inefficient.

    When this function is called on a part which was NULL previously,
    a default node on that part is first made, before the part is set
    to the argument to setPart(). This is inefficient and should be
    unnecessary.

    Priority low on this problem, as it shouldn't cause any serious
    harm.

    20040607 mortene, bug reported on coin-discuss by Nikolai Ruhe.

=====================================================================

118 Weakness in internal handling of multiple implicit references to
    the same texture.

    When reading multiple SoTexture2 nodes (and ditto for SoTexture3,
    presumably) referencing the same texture, as in this example:

--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

Separator {
  Texture2 { filename "dirt_Mossy.jpg" }
  Cube { }
}
Separator {
  Texture2 { filename "dirt_Mossy.jpg" }
  Cube { }
}
--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    ...the texture occupies n times the memory it need to do. This is
    a common way to (mis-)layout Inventor and VRML files, so we should
    really fix this so identical textures are shared.

    This should be possible to do by fixing SbImage so it implicitly
    shares the textures "behind the scenes". We then need to implement
    a copy-on-write scheme for when to "split" a texture to two
    instances, as textures can be modified programmatically after
    import.

    I believe I have read in their release notes or other
    documentation that TGS has implemented this for their Inventor
    implementation.

    This is a low-to-medium priority issue.

119 Documentation bug: SbBool is not part of the Doxygen-generated
    doc.

    Even though documented in src/misc/SoDB.cpp, documentation for
    SbBool is not generated by Doxygen. This used to work.

    Perhaps the problem is that SbBool is documented as a \class,
    while it should be a \typedef?

    Fool around with Doxygen a bit and find out why it fails, then
    make the necessary changes (to the SbBool doc block in SoDB.cpp,
    probably).

    This is a low priority issue.

120 @exec_prefix@ expansion in Coin/coin.cfg.in makes installed
    package not movable.

    Note that simply replacing with

      exec_prefix="${prefix}"

    is not the correct fix either, as an "exec_prefix" different from
    "prefix" can be set by a configure option.

    The correct solution may be to replace @exec_prefix@ with a new
    variable name (e.g. "@cfg_exec_prefix@"), then expand this to
    either "$prefix" or an absolute path, depending on how configure
    was invoked. If the latter (absolute path), warn the user at the
    end of the configure run that the installation is not movable (and
    explain why this is so)

    That's the best I can think of.

    This is a low priority issue.

    UPDATE 20051220 mortene: the same also seems to be the case for
    the So*-libraries' so*.cfg files.

=====================================================================

121 SoOffscreenRenderer tiled rendering causes problems with
    subsequent viewport changes.

    The SmallChange ViewportRegion node sets up a sub-viewport
    according to the SoGLRenderAction's viewport settings, and does
    not know about whether or not the current rendering is part of a
    tiled rendering. This causes artifacts for the commonly used
    "sub-viewport + orthocam + scene graph" trick for rendering
    overlay graphics.

    This needs to be fixed partly in Coin (there is now no mechanism
    for passing on information about whether or not we're doing tiled
    rendering), and partly in SmallChange (ViewportRegion must set up
    the sub-viewport according to the current tile).

    As for the Coin part, this could perhaps best be solved by using a
    new element "SoViewportTileElement", or some such, which should
    contain information about tilesize (absolute and
    relative). SoOffscreenRenderer should then add such an element
    to the state stack before invoking the SoGLRenderAction.

    This is a tricky issue, of fairly low priority.

    20040705 mortene.

    UPDATE 20050520 mortene: bug item #191 depends on this bug.

    UPDATE 20050520 mortene: As a side effect of this fix, SoCamera
    could then also do the view volume narrowing itself, removing the
    need for the current ugly hack in SoOffscreenRenderer to do this.

123 coin-config --setup uses hardcoded LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable name
    and is incompatible with e.g. tcsh

    Not all platforms uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH for specifying the path

    It also uses bash-style assignment of variables.

124 Manipulators and Spacemouse support

    When a manipulator receives a SoSpaceballButtonEvent::PICK event,
    it should check if it has been picked and activate itself,
    starting to listen for and react to spaceball events
    (SoMotion3Event and SoSpaceballButtonEvent).

    20040722 larsa

    UPDATE 20040909 mortene: the relevant draggers should react to
    SoMotion3Event events after any type of pick that started the
    dragger interaction, not just of the spaceball-variety, methinks.

    For convenience, should perhaps SoDragger::handleEvent() react to
    SoMotion3Event and invoke the motion callbacks in the same manner
    as it does for SoLocation2Event? (The alternative option is
    probably to have the relevant draggers set up a callback with
    SoDragger::addOtherEventCallback() and each do their particular
    processing.)

126 Coin will crash latest NVIDIA drivers with certain valid scene
    graphs.

    We've discovered a really nasty NVIDIA driver bug with using
    glColor() calls in particular ways inside display lists.

    The bug has been confirmed for the most recent Windows (61.77) and
    Linux drivers (61.11), aswell as all older drivers tested back to
    at least 52.16 (Windows).

    This is really, really, ugly, and need to be fixed ASAP. It should
    have high priority. NVIDIA cards are widespread, and many users of
    Coin (and users' users) can be hit by this.

    The best solution would be to find a decent work-around, but I
    have failed to come up with something we could do in that regard
    (I tried changing the glColor4ub() calls which seems to have a
    prominent part of the problem into other glColor*() variants, but
    to no avail). Setting the envvar IV_SEPARATOR_MAX_CACHES=0 to turn
    off GL display list generation seems to mostly work, although I
    believe I have seen a case where the bug still came up.

    20040728 mortene, bug reported by Eivind Rovik.

    UPDATE 20040802 mortene: wrote a minimal example, using only GL
    and GLUT, see

      Coin/docs/driver-bugs/2004-08-02--nvidia-v61.77.cpp

    Not yet sent to NVIDIA, awaiting confirmation from more systems
    than just our own niord.trh.sim.no

    UPDATE 20040831 mortene: provided NVIDIA with the above
    stand-alone example for them to use for reproduction and fixing
    the bug, at the <linux-bugs@nvidia.com> email address. (Couldn't
    find a proper support address for general bugs or for Windows
    bugs.)

    pederb has also suggested a work-around:

        > A Coin-workaround could be to invalidate render caches when
        > the gfx-card is nNVidia, and the material binding !=
        > OVERALL.  This can be done in MaterialBinding::GLRender()
        > and/or IndexedFaceSet::GLRender()....


    UPDATE 20040908 mortene: pederb found a usable work-around (not
    the one mentioned above, BTW), so we should be ok now. To do on
    this item: 1) check new driver releases from NVIDIA, and when it
    has been fixed, make sure the work-around only applies to older
    versions, and 2) check with pederb that his work-around is 100%
    "in place" for all relevant shape types.

129 Dragger bugs. This is a collection of bugs mostly related to
    scaling of draggers.

    JackDragger: Scale down as much as possible. Use viewAll to keep
    the geometry in focus. When a certain limit has been reached, it
    is no longer possible to click on the drag tabs. Might be because
    JackDragger uses childdraggers to do it's job, and child draggers
    currently do not have a good enough minimum scale restriction.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    JackDragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    Scale2Dragger: Scale down alot, and you will have problems with
    viewAll. Also had problems with grabbing the dragger. The geometry
    of the dragger does not get scaled properly. Some of these
    problems are probably related to the lack of a minimum scale
    restriction when using child draggers. Others are problems
    relating to the way the dragger geometry/tabs are scaled.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    Scale2Dragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    SoTabBoxDragger: Lack of minimum scale restriction because it uses
    child draggers (SoTabPlaneDraggers). The dragger geometry does not
    look correct with extremely small scale.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    TabBoxDragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    SoTransformerDragger: Geometry does not look correct when having
    non-uniform scale in the scenegraph. Load the following file into
    examinerviewer and click on the rotation tab on one of the sides,
    and you should see the problem.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    TransformerManip {}
    Text3 {
      string "b"
      parts ALL
    }
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    Also, free rotation (holding shift while rotating) does not behave
    100% as expected when the locater position goes outside of the
    projection sphere. Using the same scenegraph, press shift and
    rotate the center tab, and you will see the problem. This problem
    happens when having non-uniform scale.


    SoTransformBoxDragger: Unable to grab hold of the dragger tabs
    when scale is small. This is probably also realted to the lack of
    minimum scale restriction when using child draggers.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    TransformBoxDragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    Scale1Dragger: Impossible to grab hold of dragger tabs again after
    scaling as small as possible. Tabs should have a certain dimension
    even though the dragger has been scaled down.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    Scale1Dragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    Scale2Dragger: Difficult to repick dragger tabs when scale gets low.
    viewAll does not work properly.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    Scale2Dragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    Scale2UniformDragger: viewAll does not work as expected when scaling
    down alot. Also the geometry of the dragger gets strange when having
    low scale.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    Scale2UniformDragger {}
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]


    General observations:
     A general problem is that it is difficult to separate and click on
     a tab of choice when scale is small. This should be fixed for
     easier use. It would be nice if the tabs are spaced so that it is
     possible to see which is which. Dragger geometries should also be
     fixed so that they are intuitive and easy to use even when scale
     is small/big, etc.

     OIV does not have a restriction on the scale when using child
     draggers, but we should since without there will be trouble.

     viewAll does not always work as expected, not zooming in enough on
     some draggers under certain circumstances. This should be checked.


    Priorities:
     1) Fix minimum scale restriction when using child draggers
     2) Fix scaling/positioning of dragger geometries so that
        they are intuitive and easy to use at any scale
     3) See if the viewAll works after these bugs have been fixed.
        If not, find out what's wrong and fix it.
     4) Roam all the draggers, have fun with them and look for
        problems to fix
     5) Fix all other dragger bugs in this list :)
     6) Fix the rest of the bugs in this list (:

133 SoExtSelection selection area rendering bug

    SoGui toolkits needs to set the window id element so the
    SoExtSelection node can know which window id it is being
    manipulated in, so it doesn't render the selection area rectangle
    in all available views.

    You probably also have canvas refresh issues related to this -
    make sure the inactive views does not refresh their displays
    during interaction.

    20040831 larsa.

    UPDATE 20040831 mortene: This is a high priority item, as it
    causes Coin to be unusable when using multiple views and
    SoExtSelection together.

=====================================================================

135 Elements used by <node>::doAction() functions not automatically
    set up.

    When writing extension actions, it is a major hassle that one
    needs to explicitly enable all elements used by nodes' doAction()
    functions for the new action. It is a hassle for many reasons, not
    the least that one can not find out which elements are actually
    used without reading the source code. In addition, these are
    really implementation details that may change without notice,
    rendering client code buggy without any warning.

    So this needs to be fixed. Would probably best be done by changing
    the internals somewhat so that extension actions automatically
    inherits a list of enabled elements from SoAction aswell, and not
    just from the other actions, where this works as it should
    already.

    As an example, it should be possible to do something like this for
    e.g. SoLevelOfDetail:

    ------8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] --------------
    SoLevelOfDetail::initClass(void)
    {
      SO_NODE_INTERNAL_INIT_CLASS(SoLevelOfDetail, SO_FROM_INVENTOR_1);

     // FIXME: these elements are used from doAction(), so they should be
     // enabled for all actions.
     //   SO_ENABLE(SoAction, SoComplexityTypeElement);
     //   SO_ENABLE(SoAction, SoViewportRegionElement);
     [...]
    ------8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] --------------

    Medium priority item, we've had support requests / problem reports
    from at least two external developers about this. It is a
    non-trivial issue to fix.

139 SoText2 nodes never culled?

    Coin-user Nikolai Brezin reports on coin-discuss that his
    investigations seem to indicate that SoText2 nodes are never
    view frustum culled.

    According to pederb, this is caused by the bounding box caching
    for SoText2 to be invalidated with changes to the SoCamera node
    (as e.g. when updating the near and far planes from the viewer
    auto-clipping). So when rendering comes to the SoSeparator above
    the SoText2, no valid bbox is available, and culling will not be
    done. See also bug item #099.

    Medium priority issue: has unfortunate consequences for
    performance, especially for scenes with a lot of SoText2 nodes.

140 Rust in the SoVRMLParent machinery for keeping both an SoMFNode
    and an SoChildList of its children.

    Jochen Stier reported a problem with this on coin-discuss, and
    provided the following code for reproducing the problem:

----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------
I have a little piece of code that demonstrate the problem. As far as
I understand, all the print statements should output 1. But that is
not the case..... The refcount of the children of lGroup is
incremented during the copy, but never decremented :(
 
    SoVRMLGroup* lGroup = new SoVRMLGroup();
    lGroup->ref();
 
    lGroup->addChild(new SoVRMLGroup());
    ((SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->getChild(0))->addChild(new SoVRMLGroup());
    ((SoVRMLGroup*)((SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->getChild(0))->getChild(0))->addChild(new SoVRMLGroup());
 
    LOG<12> () << lGroup->getRefCount();
    LOG<12> () << ((SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->getChild(0))->getRefCount();
    LOG<12> () << ((SoVRMLGroup*)((SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->getChild(0))->getChild(0))->getRefCount();
 
    SoVRMLGroup* lCopy = (SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->copy();
    lCopy->ref();
 
    LOG<12> () << lGroup->getRefCount();
    LOG<12> () << ((SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->getChild(0))->getRefCount();
    LOG<12> () << ((SoVRMLGroup*)((SoVRMLGroup*)lGroup->getChild(0))->getChild(0))->getRefCount();
 
    LOG<12> () << lCopy->getRefCount();
    LOG<12> () << ((SoVRMLGroup*)lCopy->getChild(0))->getRefCount();
    LOG<12> () << ((SoVRMLGroup*)((SoVRMLGroup*)lCopy->getChild(0))->getChild(0))->getRefCount();
 ----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------

    At the least, this can lead to memory leaks as some nodes will
    never be destructed.

    The problem is related to the fact that we need to keep two copies
    of references to children nodes for an SoVRMLParent: one from the
    "children" SoMFNode field (because that is in the public API) and
    one that can be fetched from the SoNode::getChildren() method
    (also part of the public API, and used by e.g. traversal methods).

    The issue of keeping these internally in sync at all times has
    been a long-standing source of bugs, and this bug report indicates
    that it is still not working 100%.

    Consider this medium-to-high priority.

141 OpenGL context store/restore "stacking" for
    e.g. SoOffscreenRenderer will fail if different window system GL
    bindings are used in libCoin vs the main windows system binding.

    [We used to run into this on Mac OS X, where Sc21 uses
    NSOpenGLContext, and libCoin attempts to check (and restore) the
    current context with aglGetCurrentContext(), but this is now
    fixed, see update below.]

    We can in theory also get the same problem for other combinations,
    e.g. SoXt for a X11/GLX binding for the application on a Windows
    system where libCoin will use WGL internally.

    20040915 mortene, reported by kyrah.

    UPDATE 20040915 mortene, this is kintel's write-up of assumed
    problem areas and issues to cover:

        Cases in which this has potential of breaking Coin:
        o Offscreen rendering w/Cocoa [fixed]
        o Offscreen rendering using a window system layer on top of
          the native system (as Morten also pointed out), e.g. SoXt
          under Windows.
        o Offscreen rendering of a scene containing an SoSceneTexture2
          node
        o Offscreen rendering done from a callback node
        o Nested SoSceneTexture2 nodes

        What I have here is not a solution but rather requirements for
        a solution that will help implementing this properly. The
        basic mechanism for solving the problem should be the same as
        kyrah suggested initially (i.e. using callbacks into client
        code):

        o Must call back into client code (we cannot e.g. execute
          Objective-C code from Coin)
        o Must have a stack of these callbacks (to take nested
          offscreen renderers into account)
        o Must take into account that multiple threads can
          simultaneously render (by having one stack per thread?)
        o Should be able to share resources between on-screen and
          off-screen contexts:
          - Imagine rendering a huge volume with SIMVoleon and wanting
            to also offscreen render that every frame. Without texture
            sharing, this is not going to be very fast.
        o Should also support sharing between "layered" and native
          contexts:
          - Using e.g. GLX on Windows or NSOpenGL on Mac, we should
            make the offscreen context (WGL and AGL respectively) able
            to share from the layered contexts by e.g. extracting the
            core component.

    larsa's feedback:

        It must behave like a stack, but it must be implemented
        non-stackish.  I'm trying to figure out how this relates to
        how BeOS did things.  There you would have to lock a GL
        context when using it, and unlock it afterwards.  You couldn't
        lock another context while one was locked already, so you
        would basically have to unlock the onscreen rendering context
        while doing any offscreen rendering.  So that's a model that
        should fit below the surface of whatever design we end up with
        on this.  I'm not sure if this is a problem at all yet though,
        just that you wouldn't be able to translate makeCurrent() into
        Lock() calls without pairing every Lock() up with Unlock() of
        the previous context...

    Update 20051108 kyrah:

        Part of this problem (offscreen rendering in Sc21) has 
        been fixed by adding a callback interface for providing an 
        external offscreen rendering implementation (see gl.c: 
        cc_glglue_context_set_offscreen_cb_functions()). Note that 
        the other issues mentioned above ("stacked" offscreen 
        renderers, GLX-on-Windows) still remain to be resolved.

143 Warnings typically triggered from faulty input files should be

    We should provide a mechanism to hide all the warnings typically
    thrown out when encountering a buggy input file, as a service to
    applications that have little control over their input sources
    (like VRML viewers, for instance).

    A couple of ideas:

        * Provide an envvar, "COIN_DONT_WARN_ON_SCENEGRAPH" or some
          such, that can be set to turn them off.

        * Use a standard "tag" or prefix to those messages, so they
          are easy to filter out for someone installing their own
          error handler on SoError / SoDebugError.

    Both the above suggestions could be implemented. In addition, one
    needs to audit much of the Coin code to find the relevant
    invocations of SoDebugError::post[Warning]().

    Fairly low priority task.

146 Compatibility issue: SoShapeHints::windingType missing in Coin.

    This was added for TGS OIV 4.0, so we should implement this for
    compatibility reasons. We've also had an external request for
    supporting polygons with holes, which this field is the public API
    for doing.

    pederb suggests using GLU for tessellating such polygons, as
    adding that capability to SbTesselator is a non-trivial task.

    Note that this breaks ABI-compatibility, so it is only relevant
    for Coin 3.

    20041010 mortene.

    UPDATE 20041210 mortene: GLU tessellation can do polygons with
    holes, and we should probably use that for the implementation of
    this feature.

    UPDATE 20041213 kintel: The MS Windows implementation of GLU
    is known to be buggy (it crashes AFAIR) wrt. tesselating polygons
    with holes.

    UPDATE 20050809 mortene: adding the capability of tessellating
    polygons with holes to SbTessellator would perhaps be a good task
    for a student. Suggested by pederb.

    spec if they have non-default values upon export. This should be
    duly noted in their API doc, when written.

151 Incompability with Visual C++ v7.

    Trying to compile the following causes error messages from the
    compiler:

----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------
#include <Inventor/C/basic.h>
#include <complex>
----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------

    ..because our hacks to provide single precision math functions on
    platforms that are missing them fails with some code in the
    <complex> system header. I.e. this code from basic.h:

#define cosf(x) (float)cos(x)

    ..causes the following code from <complex>:

static _Ty __cdecl cos(_Ty _Left)
	{	// return cos(_Left)
	return (::cosf(_Left));
	}

    ..to fail with an error message about "illegal token on right side
    of '::'".

    The error is rather obvious, but I'm not sure how to fix
    this. Ideas would be welcome.

155 Writing of nodekits breaks, after being referenced in an earlier
    write through fieldconnections alone.

    This bug reported by Gerhard Reitmayr:

    ----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------
    I found the following problem in the CVS coin version (working on
    windows with VC 7):

    writing out a nodekit fails after a writeaction was applied to a
    node or field that was connected from it through a field
    connection.

    the WriteReference count of the nodekit is only increased through
    the connections pointing away from it's fields but never decreased
    because it was not part of the scene graph traversed (only the
    dependency graph) and therefore writeHeader is not called.

    if a later writeaction traverses the nodekit, it uses the writeref
    count to determine whether to set up an internal fielddata
    structure for writing it out.  this fails always, because the
    write ref count is then larger then 1!

    this bug is also triggered by using get method on a field that is
    connected from a field of a nodekit ! after using get, the nodekit
    will not be written out correctly anymore. This is due to the use
    of the same functions within get.

    the attached sample demonstrates this. It writes out a kit, then a
    dependend node and then the kit again.

    I was not sure how to resolve this correctly. It appeared to me
    that clearing the dictionary for write refs at some point is a
    solution, but I certainly have not the necessary overview.

#include <Inventor/SoInput.h>
#include <Inventor/SoOutput.h>
#include <Inventor/actions/SoWriteAction.h>

#include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
#include <Inventor/nodekits/SoNodeKit.h>

const char * text[] = {
"#Inventor V2.1 ascii\n",
"Separator {\n",
"    DEF KIT SeparatorKit {\n",
"        transform Transform { translation 0 1 0 }\n",
"    }\n",
"    DEF SEP Separator {\n",
"           renderCaching = USE KIT.renderCaching\n",
"    }\n",
"}",
NULL
};

int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
  SoDB::init();
  SoNodeKit::init();

  SoInput in;
  in.setStringArray(text);
  SoSeparator * root = SoDB::readAll(&in);
  root->ref();

  SoNode * sep = SoNode::getByName("SEP");
  SoNode * kit = SoNode::getByName("KIT");

  SoOutput out;

  SoWriteAction wa(&out);

  // first print out the node kit, just to see how it looks like
  wa.apply( kit );
  out.reset();

  // write out the node with fields connected from fields in the node kit
  // increases the writeref of the nodekit, but never decreases it again !!
  wa.apply( sep );
  out.reset();

  // write out the nodekit again. a test in the write implementation will
  // keep it from building the necessary fielddata structure to write out
  // its parts and fields !
  wa.apply( kit );
  out.reset();

  root->unref();

  return 0;
}
    ----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------

    Update. After reimplementing some of the Writeref-counting system,
    this bug is now fixed. There is still a warning about "KIT" not
    being removed from the writeref dict, so keep this
    bugreport here until this is solved. pederb, 2004-11-08

157 SoFont does not support styles under Windows.

    When adding a style to a fontname, the fallback font is used
    instead (Arial). This wrl file recreates the problem:

----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

Font { name "Times New Roman:Bold" }
Text2 { string "test" }
----8<----- [snip] --------------------8<----- [snip] ----------------

    (This works fine when using FreeType on Linux.)

    20041102 handegar

    UPDATE 20041102 mortene: note that it works as expected when
    removing the ":Bold"-suffix, which indicates that the string we
    pass to Win32's CreateFont() is wrong. Most likely it needs to be
    broken up properly, and we should probably pass the information
    about "bold" weighting as one of the other arguments to the
    CreateFont() call, and not as part of the font name.

    When taking care of this bug, please also check how "italics" and
    other styles works (or not works).

=====================================================================

162 Inconsistent traversal behavior upon traversal of VRML97-nodes
    with SoSFNode and/or SoMFNode fields.

    According to pederb, only some VRML97-nodes forwards scene graph
    traversal to the sub-graphs in their SoSFNode- or SoMFNode-fields.

    E.g. SoVRMLText does not traverse its fontStyle field, but
    SoVRMLShape and SoVRMLAppearance traverses their SoSFNode-fields.

    Is there any good reason why we should /not/ let all nodes
    continue traversing down into SoSFNode and SoMFNode fields? If
    not, this should be fixed.

    20041104 mortene, reported by kintel.

    UPDATE 20050711 mortene: see also item #196, which seems to be the
    same issue.

178 SbMatrixd and SbRotationd missing from Coin.

    These classes are present both in TGS Inventor and in Coin, but in

=====================================================================

180 Leaving the SoType classTypeId to be set implicitly to bit pattern
    0x0000 doesn't work with the Intel compiler.

    This means the following code from SoSubField.h must be fixed, and
    similar code other places (SoNode.cpp, SoBase.cpp, others):

      /* Don't set value explicitly to SoType::badType(), to avoid a bug in */ \
      /* Sun CC v4.0. (Bitpattern 0x0000 equals SoType::badType()). */ \
      SoType _class_::classTypeId;

    This code used to be

      SoType _class_::classTypeId = SoType::badType();

    but as the code comment indicates, this triggered a bug in Sun CC
    v4.0, so we ended up with the somewhat hack-ish solution, which is
    now found to fail with the Intel compiler (tested with the latest
    release) in the following manner: the classTypeId variables will
    be set to a random (?) non-0x000 value, which triggers the
    assert-checks that detects whether any init()/initClass() method
    is called multiple times.

    pederb suggests fixing this by adding a separate static variable
    to the classes, as a flag which remembers whether or not it was
    initialized.

=====================================================================

181 SoSFEnum::operator=() not implemented, and not blocked.

    Leads to trouble, as the default operator will _not_ do the right
    thing (it will just make a bit-wise copy).

    This is very likely a problem for all SoField-derived classes, and
    should be fixed for all of them. The best solution is probably to
    write an empty, private operator=(), so faulty client code is
    caught be the compiler.

    20041217 mortene.

    UPDATE 20050103 mortene: this bug report is bogus. pederb had a
    problem reported that he believed to be caused by this, but
    further investigation revealed that everything seems to be in
    order in this respect. Further investigation is needed to figure
    out the real cause of the reported bug.

=====================================================================

184 SbOctTree::findItems() functions not multi-CRT safe on Windows.

    The SbList-use in the function signatures of these strongly
    indicates that they can cause problems when used in a run-time
    environment where the client code uses a different CRT than the
    Coin DLL.

    (By mixing allocation and deallocation of memory from different
    CRT heaps, which causes hard-to-find memory corruption bugs.)

    Probably best solved in a similar manner as has been done before
    for a few other classes: duplicate these functions, but with a
    safe signature, then deprecate the use of the original ones.

191 SoOffscreenRenderer bug with SoOrthographicCamera in multitile-mode.

    The following iv-file results in a faulty image when fed to the
    Ivtools/renderos/renderos example, using a tile size of 512x512:

----8<-------------- [snip] -------8<-------------- [snip] -------------
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

OrthographicCamera {
   viewportMapping CROP_VIEWPORT_LINE_FRAME
   nearDistance 0.1
   farDistance 53000
   height 6393.33333333333
   position -15206.092773 9440.072266 17456.371094
   orientation -0.536894 -0.843216 0.027043   0.798199
}

Cube {
   width 500
   height 100
   depth 50000
}
----8<-------------- [snip] -------8<-------------- [snip] -------------

    To reproduce with a forced tile size of 512x512, set the following
    envvars:

        COIN_OFFSCREENRENDERER_TILEWIDTH=512
        COIN_OFFSCREENRENDERER_TILEHEIGHT=512

    It appears to have something to do with the SoOffscreenRenderer
    camera view volume narrowing to not work correctly with the
    cropped viewport, as commenting out the "viewportMapping" field of
    the camera causes the bug to go away.

    20050519 mortene.

    Yes. SoCamera will render a frame in the viewport when the
    viewport mapping is set to one of the CROP modes. To fix this we
    need a new element called SoViewportTile or something to make it
    possible for SoCamera to detect that the SoGLRenderAction is
    actually rendering a tile in the viewport, and not the entire
    viewport. This is also needed to make other viewport-based
    rendering nodes, such as legend, work.

    I don't know if SoViewportTileElement is a good idea though, since
    it will complicate the CROP rendering code in SoCamera quite a
    bit. 

    Another idea: Is it possible to use the WindowSize-parameter in
    SbViewportRegion to specify the entire viewport? This must be done
    _after_ the viewport is initialized in the GL context though, maybe
    in a pre-camera callback or something.

    20050519 pederb

    UPDATE 20050520 mortene: after discussion with pederb, we consider
    the Correct Fix for this to first take care of bug item #121. This
    means the SoOffscreenRenderer adding an element to the state stack
    upon traversal start which identifies the current tile to be
    rendered (i.e. containing row and column index, and ditto
    dimensions), and then leaving it to SoCamera to render the
    viewport cropping correctly. (As a side effect, SoCamera could
    then also do the view volume narrowing itself, removing the need
    for the current ugly hack in SoOffscreenRenderer to do this.)

    UPDATE 20050714 mortene: there's something else odd going on
    here... if the tilewidth and -height is set to 640 and 480,
    respectively, which is the same as the default size of renderos'
    buffer, it also comes out wrong -- but only if tiled rendering is
    *not* used. If we on the other hand force tiled rendering on (by
    using the envvar COIN_FORCE_TILED_OFFSCREENRENDERING=1), and the
    tile size is at least of dimensions 640x480, everything works..?
    Strange.

193 superglu should be sync'ed against SGI GLU.

    This should be done with regular intervals, to get any bug fixes
    etc migrated into superglu. This hasn't been done for a long time
    now.

    We should also send back any important bugfixes we've made
    ourselves.

    20050602 mortene.

     UPDATE 20060130 mortene:

        I made a small amount of fixes, some important, but most of
        them syntactic (making their original C code also compilable
        by a C++ compiler, for instance) when I grabbed the GLU source
        code and made the "superglu" repository.

        So to sync up, one should really first do something like a
        "cvs diff -u -r <start> -r <today>" on the repository, sort
        through the diff and pass on to the responsible SGI engineer.

        Then sync with the changes made to GLU between our fork date
        and today.

        It's a non-trivial task, partly because I've been sloppy
        enough to let it drift / rot.

194 SoOffscreenRenderer in tile-mode asserts on VRML97 scene graph.

    The following scene graph attempted drawn with an
    SoOffscreenRenderer (use e.g. the 'osgrab' debugging backdoor in
    an examiner viewer to reproduce) causes an assert to hit in
    SoOffscreenRenderer, due to the tail of the
    SoGLRenderAction::getCurPath() being NULL at one point. The tail
    of the path should likely never become NULL.

    pederb suggests that this should be fix be extending the
    SoVRMLParent etc hack by duplicating MFNode contents into "hidden"
    SoChildList instances. pederb has a framework for this in:

        void SoVRMLParent::updateChildList(SoNode * nodewithsfnode, SoChildList & cl)

    Note: is there some other, more fundamental, way we could fix this
    without applying this hack?  It's not very nice, and is giving us
    headaches now and then with bugs which are the results of these
    SoChildList instances not kept in sync.

    20050609 mortene.

    UPDATE 20050711 mortene: see also item #162, which seems to be the
    same issue.

    UPDATE 20060130 mortene:

      This is a /really/ tricky issue, and one which we don't really
      know yet how to fix:

      The source of the problem is that VRML nodes use SoSFNode and
      SoMFNode *fields* to keep track of their child nodes, while the
      "traditional" Inventor nodes use the SoChildList class.

      For certain functionality of the library, we do however need a
      SoChildList -- like for e.g. SoPath-instances being able to
      track their way down through the scene graph.

      So to work around this problem, there is a hack in place at
      various spots in the VRML nodes with MFNode "children" field(s):
      the node internally keeps an SoChildList, which is attempted
      kept synchronized with the MFNode field. This SoChildList
      instance is then available through the virtual
      SoNode::getChildren() method, just as for the "normal" Inventor
      nodes.

      This hack does however have certain ugly weaknesses:

        * it has not been set up everywhere it is probably needed
          (none or few of the nodes with SoSFNode fields have an
          SoChildList "on the side", for instance)

        * it causes various problems with the SoPath class, which has
          no knowledge of SoSFNode / SoMFNode, and is completely and
          utterly geared towards going through SoChildList

        * there is copy'n'paste-jobs of code for
          SoChildList<->SoMFNode synchronization at various places --
          code which is not straightforward to bug-fix and maintain

        * the SoNode::getChildren() method returns a mutable
          SoChildList (!)

      So, this is one of the really major design flaws of the library,
      and it looks like we need a stroke of genius to resolve this
      knot.

      One venue which may be interesting to investigate would be to
      see if letting SoChildList take care of the synchronization vs
      SoSFNode & SoMFNode fields would be sensible. Or perhaps let the
      SoMFNode and SoSFNode classes have a built-in SoChildList which
      they could auto-sync?

      Another option which may be a possibility would be to let SoPath
      know about SoMFNode and SoSFNode. My gut feeling about that one
      is that it would quickly make the SoPath API a lot uglier, tho'.

      I've been asked for an estimate on this task, but given that we
      don't yet know /how/ to fix it, makes this impossible as of
      now. I'm quite certain however that we are talking about > 1
      week of efficient coding and testing.

197 Compatibility issue: SoDB::threadInit() not implemented in Coin.

    Not really needed in Coin, but should be present for TGS Inventor
    API compatibility.

    Note: the So* libraries also have threadInit() functions --
    implement those too.

    This is a minor issue.

198 MS Windows DLL versioning.

    For several good reasons[*], we should add the version number to

    See following URL for information on the VERSIONINFO resource:

    [*] Helpful when working with more than 1 Coin DLL on a system,
    during debugging sessions, for instance, as a DLL version number

200 "Fake" NVidia stereo reported to not work with Coin / SoWin/SoQt.

    There's an add-on to NVidia's drivers at

      http://www.nvidia.com/object/3dstereo_71.89

    ..which I assume uses some kind of trick to make a stereo signal
    out of a mono GL scene (intercepting and transforming the camera-
    and projection-related state changes?). This is reported to not
    work with Coin: the (attempted) stereo images comes out with
    strange rendering artifacts, which seems to stem from the camera
    settings being wrong.

    For a user's guide, see:

        http://download.nvidia.com/Windows/71.89/71.89_ForceWare_3D_Stereo_Users_Guide.pdf

    And a more technical overview:

        http://www.nvidia.com/attach/168471?type=support&primitive=0

    The reporter's system:

        * NVidia Geforce6800 Graphicscard
        * Windows XP
        * latest NVidia drivers + NVidia 3D Stereo Driver
        * Coin 2.4.2

    He also reproduced the problem with an NVidia Quadro. The driver
    add-on likely also works with other (and older) NVidia cards.

    To reproduce, running SoGuiExamples' components/simpleexviewer is
    sufficient, as long as this is done to the viewer configuration
    (or the stereo will not kick in):

        viewer->setFullScreen(TRUE);
        viewer->setDecoration(FALSE);

201 Coin 2.4.1 + SoQt 1.2.0 + Qt 3.3.4 hangs on Win98.

    We've had an external report that the above combination hangs on
    Win98 systems, even when just attempting to display a simple
    SoQtRenderArea. The same combination, but with Coin 2.2.1, does
    not hang (!). It is unclear whether or not they tried with SoQt
    from CVS.

    The reporter gets the following error message in the terminal
    window where the application is run from, and supplies to
    following information:

----8<-------------- [snip] -------8<-------------- [snip] -------------
        ---------------
        GetModuleHandleA succeed

        LoadLibrary returns baaa0000
        not a dibseciton
        fail GetSurfaceFromDC, ddVal = 887600ff

        bddraw = 1

        fail GetSurfaceFromDC, ddVal = 887600ff

        bddraw = 1

        not a dibseciton
        fail GetSurfaceFromDC, ddVal = 887600ff

        bddraw = 1
        ---------------

        The corresponding Window stays lightgrey (backgroundcolor set
        to black) and the CPU Load rises to 100%. Termination of the
        Task is not possible (Win98) and so I have to make a hard
        reset.

202 SoLocateHighlight implementation is inefficient.

    Our implementation of the SoLocateHighlight is quite inefficient,
    re-rendering the whole scene -- instead of just the part(s) that
    should be highlighted.

    A better implementation would perhaps just re-render the selected
    geometry to the OpenGL front buffer after the scene was rendered
    once.

    This problem reduces the value of an otherwise very useful node.

    20050630 mortene.

    UPDATE 20060130 mortene:

      I'm not sure whether or not we actually *want* to render to the
      front buffer -- couldn't just "grabbing" the front-buffer
      resource bring along other problems?

      Also, is this optimization really useful? I can't see it make
      much difference unless there is so much geometry in the scene
      that a full re-render takes a lot of time -- and a lot more than
      just rendering the highlighted part(s). And if the application
      has that problem, it usually has other, more pressing issues to
      take care of anyway -- like getting "normal" rendering to be
      faster.

203 openal.dll instances may have different calling convention.

    Different than the custom under Windows, and different than from
    what we assume it is. This causes a crash on those platforms when
    attempts are made at using sound. (The first attempt at calling an
    openal.dll function will crash the application, because of
    unexpected stack layout on return.)

    My suggestion for a "best fix" would be to include code in Coin to
    detect the calling convention used for a DLL. To do this, one
    needs to do some trickery with checking the stack pointer after
    calling a function of the DLL -- something which probably requires
    some x86 assembly programming.

    This is still not a perfect fix, as functions in a DLL can have
    different calling conventions. Perhaps it would be possible to
    query the DLL directly about this? Request for assistance at a
    Usenet Windows programming group did not result in any useful
    hints for how to do this.

205 Hardcopy export does not work correctly with viewport region
    changes.

    As reported on coin-discuss by user Ole Jacob Hagen:

        > Generating a postscript file when my scenegraph consists of
        > one instance of Smallchange's [ViewportRegion] works, but
        > when I have arranged my scenegraphs into four viewports
        > (2x2-array) it doesn't work.

    Is this a bug or a limitation? Waiting for pederb's input on this.

208 Too high tessellation by default for 3D text?

    The 06.3.Complex3DText example updates at a very slow framerate,
    so it seems like our default settings for 3D text complexity is
    too high.

    Investigate, compare with SGI Inventor.

    Not particularly high priority item.

209 Bug with SoTranslate1Dragger.

    The following iv-file should work the same in Coin as in SGI
    Inventor, but it doesn't:

----8<-------------- [snip] -------8<-------------- [snip] -------------
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

Switch { DEF DRAG Translate1Dragger { } }

RotationXYZ {
   angle  = DecomposeVec3f { vector = USE DRAG.translation }.x
   axis Z
}

USE DRAG

Cube { width 0.5 height 0.5 depth 0.5 }
Separator {
   Translation { translation 0 -5 0 }
   Cylinder { radius 0.2 height 10 }
}
Translation { translation 0 -10 0 }
Sphere { radius 0.4 }
----8<-------------- [snip] -------8<-------------- [snip] -------------

    In Coin, the dragger geometry is translated, for some odd
    reason. In SGI Inventor, it only rotates along with the rest of
    the geometry, as expected.

    20051208 mortene.

    UPDATE 20060130 mortene:

      As for an estimate on this bug, I expect it to be on the order
      of just a few hours to fix. Need to investigate and figure out
      why it happens, and the fix is likely to just be a little
      modification of the internal default geometry for the dragger,
      i.e. to the Coin/data/draggerDefaults/translate1Dragger.iv file.

210 SoText2 font size policy in Coin incompatible with SGI / TGS
    Inventor?

    According to Frank Hibbeln:

> The doc's for SoFont indicate the size for Text2 nodes is
> interpreted as pixels whereas the TGS Inventor doc's indicate it's
> "printer points" (ie i point = 1/72 inch ).

    Should investigate this with SGI Inventor, and see if we need to
    fix anything for Coin.
