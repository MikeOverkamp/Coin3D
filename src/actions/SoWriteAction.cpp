  \class SoWriteAction SoWriteAction.h Inventor/actions/SoWriteAction.h
  \brief The SoWriteAction class writes a scene graph to file.
  \ingroup actions

  When applied to a scene, this action writes its contents to the
  stream contained within an SoOutput instance. This can be a file, a
  memory buffer or a system filehandle like \c stdout, for instance.

  \e All information considered part of the scene graph should be
  written out, including not only nodes, but also the nodes' field
  values, global fields (at least those with connections inside the
  scene the action is applied to), engines in the scene, paths, etc.

  The scene is written in the Open Inventor file format. Files in this
  format can be parsed into their scene graph structures by using the
  SoDB::readAll() method (SoDB also contains a few other import
  methods you can use).

  \sa SoOutput

  Compact path lists are not implemented in Coin (yet), but if they
  are, SoWriteAction should return \c FALSE here -- it would only be

  Seems like a silly optimization to me, though.. :^/  20000306 mortene.
