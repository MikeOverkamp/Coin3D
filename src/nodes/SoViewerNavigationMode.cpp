  \class SoViewerNavigationMode Inventor/nodes/SoViewerNavigationMode.h
  \brief Node for setting the default viewer navigation mode for a scene graph.

  This node provides a way to hint to the SoSceneManager which
  navigation mode you want to use with a scene graph.

  The node must be placed before the first camera in the scene graph,
  or it will not be found by the system that searches for this node.

  It will only work in cooperation with the SoSceneManager.  If for
  instance just the regular SoSceneManager is used in the viewer, this
  node does absolutely nothing.

  Currently, the mode field of the node is not monitored for dynamic
  changes, so updating it will not change the viewer mode.  Doing this is
  a possibility for future enhancement.

  Be aware that "navigation mode" in this context translates to a
  complete navigation system (SoNavigationSystem), and not an atomic
  navigation submode (SoNavigationMode).

/*!
  \var SoSFString SoViewerNavigationMode::mode

  The mode field is used for setting the name of the desired mode.
  If the mode is not found in the system, no mode will be used.

  The builtin modes are currently limited to "examiner", "panner",
  "zoomer", and "rotater".  In addition, application developers can
  extend the list with their own custom modes.
