  Sets the flag returned from SoBoundingBoxCache::hasLinesOrPoints()

  The reason bounding box caches keep a lines-or-points flag is to
  make it known to client code if the shape(s) they contain have any
  of these primitives -- or are rendered with these primitives. The
  reason this is important to know for the client code is because it
  might need to add an "epsilon" slack value to the calculated
  bounding box to account for smoothing / anti-aliasing effects in the
  renderer, so lines and points graphics is not accidently clipped by
  near and far clipping planes, for instance.

  This method is a static method on the class. It will upon invocation
  scan through the state stack and set the flag for all open
  SoBoundingBoxCache elements. It has been made to work like this so
  it can easily be invoked on all current bounding box cache instances
  from the SoShape-type nodes using lines and / or point primitives.
