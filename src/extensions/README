This directory is for optional extensions to the Coin core library.
The only optional extension we have support for at the moment is
a custom version of GLU 1.3 which we have called superglu.  If you
have problems with GLU, it might be worth checking out.  Otherwise,
just ignore it.

To embed superglu in Coin, CVS checkout superglu into this directory
like this:

  cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.coin3d.org:/export/cvsroot co superglu
  (if you need to log in, password is empty - just press enter)

Then rerun configure and rebuild Coin.
