UPDATE 2003-01-30 mortene: looks like a whole bunch of new nodes has
been added to the standard, see

  <URL:http://www.web3d.org/technicalinfo/specifications/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html>

How the heck can they do that? Isn't this supposed to be a _standard_?
We should really look closer into this and get it explained.
