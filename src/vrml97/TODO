Unsupported features
====================

- Anchor
- AudioClip/Sound
- Collision node and viewer support
- EXTERNPROTO (passthrough)
- bindable nodes (Fog, Background, Viewpoint etc).
- Heed min/maxAngle in CylinderSensor
- FontStyle node.
- Caching/culling in SoVRMLGroup
- prequalify callback in ImageTexture
- The MovieTexture node
- The NavigationInfo node (should be supported by viewer mostly though).
- PixelTexture SoCallbackAction support.
- Script (currently only passthrough).
- Radius in PointLight is not supported
- Radius or beamWidth in SpotLight is not supported.
- The Text node

- SoVRMLPointLight and SoVRMLSpotLight should affect all geometry
  within their radius, not only under their Group/Transform/Parent,
  and including geometry that precedes them in the scene graph.

  Note that this is /not/ the case for SoVRMLDirectionalLight.

UPDATE 2003-01-30 mortene: looks like a whole bunch of new nodes has
been added to the standard, see

  <URL:http://www.web3d.org/technicalinfo/specifications/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html>

How the heck can they do that? Isn't this supposed to be a _standard_?
We should really look closer into this and get it explained.
