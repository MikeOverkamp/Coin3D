  \class SoPickedPointList SoPickedPointList.h Inventor/lists/SoPickedPointList.h
  \brief The SoPickedPointList class is a container for pointers to SoPickedPoint objects.
  \ingroup general

  \sa SbList
*/

// SoPickedPointList was moved from being a subclass of SbPList to
// being a subclass of SbList. This removed the need to do lots of
// ugly casts in overridden methods, with the subsequent removal of
// all code in this file. 20000228 mortene.

/*!
  \fn SoPickedPointList::SoPickedPointList(void)

  Default constructor.
*/

/*!
  \fn SoPickedPointList::SoPickedPointList(const int sizehint)

  This constructor initializes the internal allocated size for the
  list to \a sizehint. Note that the list will still initially contain
  zero items.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const int sizehint)
*/

/*!
  \fn SoPickedPointList::SoPickedPointList(const SoPickedPointList & l)

  Copy constructor.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const SbList<Type> & l)
*/

/*!
  \fn void SoPickedPointList::set(const int index, SoPickedPoint * item)

  This method sets the element at \a index to \a item. Does the same
  thing as SbList::operator[](). This method is only present for
  compatibility with the original Inventor API.
