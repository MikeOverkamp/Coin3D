RELEASE NOTES
=============

This file describes notable changes in the Coin library in a more
elaborate way than can be fit into to the compact NEWS summary file.

The changes described here are issues that might have an effect on the
compatibility of your source code when upgrading the library.


Coin 3.0.0
==========


Coin 2.0.0
==========

Removed obsoleted methods in SoField:

  SbBool connectFrom(SoVRMLInterpOutput * master,
                     SbBool notnotify = FALSE, SbBool append = FALSE);
  SbBool appendConnection(SoVRMLInterpOutput * master,
                          SbBool notnotify = FALSE);
  void disconnect(SoVRMLInterpOutput * interpoutput);
  SbBool isConnectedFromVRMLInterp(void) const;
  SbBool getConnectedVRMLInterp(SoVRMLInterpOutput *& master) const;

These methods were obsoleted in Coin-1, and we chose to remove them
in Coin-2.

Changed behaviour of CLAMP texture wrap mode

  When CLAMP is specified as the texture wrap mode (for SoTexture2 or 
  SoTexture3), the OpenGL feature GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE will be used instead 
  of GL_CLAMP. This is done since GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE is usually what you 
  want. Especially for Coin/Open Inventor where it's impossible to specify
  the texture border color used by GL_CLAMP. The environment variable 
  COIN_ENABLE_CONFORMANT_GL_CLAMP can be set to "1" to force Coin to use 
  GL_CLAMP instead of GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
