RELEASE NOTES
=============

This file describes notable changes in the Coin library in a more
elaborate way than can be fit into to the compact NEWS summary file.

Coin 2.0.0
==========

Removed obsoleted methods in SoField:

  SbBool connectFrom(SoVRMLInterpOutput * master,
                     SbBool notnotify = FALSE, SbBool append = FALSE);
  SbBool appendConnection(SoVRMLInterpOutput * master,
                          SbBool notnotify = FALSE);
  void disconnect(SoVRMLInterpOutput * interpoutput);
  SbBool isConnectedFromVRMLInterp(void) const;
  SbBool getConnectedVRMLInterp(SoVRMLInterpOutput *& master) const;

These methods were obsoleted in Coin-1, and we chose to remove them
in Coin-2.
