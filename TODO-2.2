If anyone can think of stuff that really should be done for Coin 2.2.0
before release, please put it here.

* Implement following GL glue methods (might be needed if we change to render
  with vertex array techniques):

  cc_glglue_glPushClientAttrib()
  cc_glglue_glPopClientAttrib()

* Sync with the new TTF font import capabilities from Coin development
  branch.

* Write doxygen doc pages for "related pages" on basic use of
    SoTextureUnit
    SoBumpMap
    SoSceneTexture2
