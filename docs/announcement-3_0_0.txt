Coin 3.0.0 "Buffalo" RC1
========================

Kongsberg SIM is proud to make Release Candidate 1 (RC1) of version 3.0.0
of the Coin 3D graphics library available.  Coin 3.0.0 RC1 will be identical
to the Coin 3.0.0 "Buffalo" proper release, released shortly, given that no
showstopper bugs are found in the release candidate.

Coin 3.0.0 is a major release.  It breaks binary compatibility with previous
versions of Coin, but is for the most part upward source code compatible with
Coin 2.*.

The Coin 3.0 series will be the last releases of Coin to support the
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler.
