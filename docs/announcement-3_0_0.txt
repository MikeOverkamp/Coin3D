Coin 3.0.0 "Buffalo" RC1
========================

Kongsberg SIM is proud to make Release Candidate 1 (RC1) of version 3.0.0 of
the Coin 3D graphics library available.  Coin 3.0.0 RC1 will be identical to
the Coin 3.0.0 "Buffalo" proper release, released shortly, given that no
showstopper bugs are found in the release candidate.

Coin 3.0.0 is a major release.  It breaks binary compatibility with previous
versions of Coin, but is for the most part upward source code compatible
with Coin 2.*.  A new major release means it was time for doing
cleanup-duties.  Some dead-end developments were removed, certain
ABI-preservation-related hacks were rewritten properly.  Certain poor design
choices were improved upon.

Coin 3.0.0 is not a release which is a massive roll-out of new features.
Resources have at times been stretched, but we have managed to accumulate a
decent set of features for a release anyway, and internal to Coin we have
many new subsystems to build future features on.

While we have your attention, it should also be mentioned that the Coin 3.0
series will be the last set of releases of Coin to support the archaic
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, which has become a really a big pain to
keep supporting at this point, C++-language-wise.  Just a word of warning to
VC++6.0 users out there.  This is the beginning of the end of the line.
